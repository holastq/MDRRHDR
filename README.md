# MDRRHDR
Our project proposes a multi-domain HDR reconstruction model based on inverse RAW generation, which restores intrinsic scene information by simulating the inverse of the camera's RAW-to-LDR pipeline and achieves HDR reconstruction from a single LDR image through luminance enhancement in both spatial and frequency domains.
